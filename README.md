# Visually-Indicated-Sounds

CV Project

## What needs to be done:

* [x] create a dataloader for the dataset
  * [ ] could use speedup for video/audio loading
  * [x] check video/audio is in sync
* [x] create training-validation-test sets
* [ ] use the previous work/network as a basis
* [ ] feed concat image/audio into the network (can be extended to video)
* [ ] discriminator network to see if image/audio is real or fake
* [ ] create new data outside the drumstick dataset to see how it generalizes
